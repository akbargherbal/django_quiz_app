## Remaining Tasks

### Stage 3: Views and Templates

#### Easy Tasks

6. Add breadcrumb navigation to improve user orientation
7. Create a custom 404 error page
8. Implement a basic search functionality for quizzes on the home page

#### Complex Tasks
9. Optimize database queries in views to reduce loading times
10. Implement caching for frequently accessed data (e.g., quiz list on home page)
11. Create a dashboard view summarizing user's quiz activity (taken and created quizzes)

### Stage 4: Forms and User Input

#### Easy Tasks
1. Add client-side form validation using HTML5 attributes (e.g., required, min, max)
2. Implement CSRF protection for all forms (if not already done)

## General Improvements

1. Review and enhance error handling throughout the application
2. Improve accessibility by adding ARIA attributes and ensuring keyboard navigation
3. Optimize templates for better performance (e.g., using template fragments)
4. Implement comprehensive logging for better debugging and monitoring
5. Conduct a security audit of views and forms to identify and address potential vulnerabilities

When you return to the project, you can start with the easy tasks and progressively move to the more complex ones. This approach will allow you to make steady progress while building up to the more challenging aspects of the implementation.
