Project Name: QuizMaster (Simple Quiz App)
Project Description: 
QuizMaster is a web-based quiz application inspired by popular platforms like Quizizz and Kahoot. It allows users to create and take quizzes. Single-player mode is what I aiming for.

Current focus is on multiple-choice quizzes; later after I finish successfully deploying the app, I might add other functionalities like other simple quiz types, like True/False, reorder or flashcards etc.

Stack: I'm using Django framework for the backend. The front-end utilizes HTMX and AlpineJS to deliver interactive user experience.


Current Stage of development: stage 3 Views and Templates and stage 4 Forms and User Input (as per development tempalate given to you)

Latest Implementation (if any): 
Implemented custom template tag
See code existing codebase:


Current Roadblock (if any):
Problem: Take a quiz on homepage, answer all questions, then click Submit button; then redirect to the page:
/results/<int>/

Showing the following message:

<div class="bg-white dark:bg-[#0d1117] rounded-lg shadow-lg p-6">
    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 text-[#6e7681] dark:text-[#c9d1d9]">Error</h1>
    <p class="text-[#8b949e] dark:text-[#8b949e] mb-6">An unexpected error occurred: Invalid filter: 'div'</p>
    <a href="/" class="bg-[#238636] text-white rounded-full py-2 px-4 hover:bg-[#238636]/80 transition-colors">Return to Home</a>
  </div>
  


Next Feature you want to implement: Continue with finishing stage 3 and 4, so we can move to the next stage (Stage 5. HTMX Integration).
